The course does not require a background in computer science. However, the focus of this course will be the societal and ethical issues that arise in computer science; from hardware to software, the collection, storage, sharing, and analyzation of data, and how they are all tied together in modern society. The course explores various aspects of the computer science field and how each of these aspects has its own complications, consequences, and concerns.

### Baccalaureate Core Course Statement:
This course fulfills the Baccalaureate Core Science, Technology, and Society requirement. For people working in the advanced field of Computer Science, technological progress seems painfully slow. On the other hand, there are many who argue that the forces of technology are already too strong and changing too quickly for society to handle. Given this polarity of thinking, this course provides an opportunity to confront the social, legal, and ethical issues caused by the problems and advances in the field in order to be socially responsible producers and consumers of technologies.

### Baccalaureate Core Science, Technology and Society Category Learning Outcomes:
Students in Science, Technology, and Society courses shall:
1. Analyze the role of science and technology in shaping diverse fields of study over time. 2. Analyze relationships among science, technology, and society using critical perspectives
or examples from historical, political, or economic disciplines.
3. Articulate in writing a critical perspective on issues involving science, technology, and
society using evidence as support.

### Evaluation of Baccalaureate Core Category Learning Outcomes:
The assessment matrix below provides a description of how Baccalaureate Core category learning outcomes will be assessed within the course.

### Baccalaureate Core Learning Outcomes Assessment Matrix
Outcome | How will this outcome be addressed in this course assessed in this course | How will this outcome be addressed in this course assessed in this course
-|-|-
Analyze relationships among science, technology, and society using critical perspectives or examples from historical, political, or economic disciplines. | The relationship between computing and society will be analyzed using ethical theories such as Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Social Contract Theory, and Virtue Theory. These relationships will be explored through historical case studies and current events. For example, students could use one of the ethical theories to analyze the use of Artificial Intelligence to create lethal autonomous weapons. | On-line discussion forums and in-class discussions will provide opportunities for students to analyze and understand these relationships. Students will be assessed through their participation in these discussions. In addition, students will be evaluated through essays and a final report that require them to analyze a topic or case study using one or more ethical theory. In-class debates may also be used to assess their understanding of the relationships among science, technology, and society through a critical perspective.
Analyze the role of science and technology in shaping diverse fields of study over time. | Students will analyze how social and ethical issues have been impacted over time with advancements in science and technology, especially due to computing. In particular, this course will focus on how advances in computing have affected public policy, laws, professional ethics and social relationships. An example of a topic covered in this class is the effect of social media on society in terms of relationships, data privacy and constitutional / civil liberties. | Instructors will use the discussion boards and in-class questions to stimulate discussion on the course topics. These discussions will require students to analyze the discussion topics using materials taught in class. Students may also be asked to provide their personal views and experiences. Students will be assessed through their participation in these discussions. Students will also be assessed through multiple essay assignments that explore the impact of computing on societal and ethical issues.
Articulate in writing a critical perspective on issues involving science, technology, and society using evidence as support. | Students will engage in a critical analysis of a proposition related to computing and society, specifically focusing on how advances in computing that have led to emerging issues in society. This proposition could be a particular policy, law or position regarding computing taken by government, industry, or an institution. As an example, students could be asked to provide a critical analysis regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the effects on society of the proposed amendments to it. Student will be expected to conduct research to build a compelling argument either for or against a particular position regarding this proposition. | Students will be assigned multiple essay assignments and a final report in which they will take a critical perspective of a topic regarding the problems or benefits caused by advances in computing and explore it in sufficient depth, providing compelling supporting evidence through reliable sources, such as peer- reviewed articles, for their critical perspective. In total, the essay assignments and the final report will meet the bacc core writing requirement of at least 1250 words with at least two outside sources.

## Course Policies
### Discussion Participation
Students are expected to participate in all graded discussions. While there is great flexibility in online courses, this is not a self-paced course. Discussion participation is expected and mandatory.

If you are not active in your Canvas discussion groups or on Teams, you will be missing a large portion of the mandatory requirements of this course. Discussions are meant for you to all experience various perspectives, understand the viewpoint from other backgrounds and cultures, and learn from your peers. Understanding ethics and morality in society is going to require a communal effort. We ask that you stay professional and civil; ethics and morality are fluid topics with no one right or wrong answer. Differences of opinion are expected and will enrich your experience. Embrace various viewpoints and refrain from being accusatory or combative in your discussions. Explain your side, your viewpoint, and your opinion while avoiding downplaying or disrespecting someone else's.

### Managing this course
Each weekly module will have three pages: "Overview", "Learn", and "Assignments". The Overview page will give a brief listing of the week's topics, the learning outcomes, and the tasks you need to accomplish. The Learn page will have content for you to read and understand. Sometimes it will include videos, reading links, or activities to help you grasp the material. The Assignments page will have instructions for all of the work that is due for that module, with submission links. Sometimes there will be special "required reading" on the Overview page, which you will need to read for the quizzes or assignments.

### Videos and Reading Links
Each module will contain a variety of videos, referenced articles, and some interactive tools. You are expected to watch all videos on the Learn pages and/or within the assignments. These videos provide a broader explanation and/or professional and nonprofessional examinations of the topic being discussed.

Throughout the Learn pages, you will notice articles that are referenced within instruction. You are expected to familiarize yourself with the full perspective of the reading, not just my snippet or description. One way to eliminate bias is to have the full story. My perspective of the reading is not what is important; rather, an understanding of your own perspective is.

### Assignment Modifications
Assignments changes that require updates to the content of the assignment will generally be minimal and be released at least 5 days before the assignment’s due date. Changes that only impact the formatting of the deliverables (file type, number of files etc) can be changed up to 3 days prior to the assignment due date.

### Late Work Policy
Each assignment must be submitted before the Due date and time as specified on the Canvas Home tab. The Available Until date and time constitutes a grace period, which can be used in an emergency, or if you are ill (it cannot be used for every assignment). Students who submit using the Available Until date may incur score reduction. Students on a DAS Flexibility Contract typically have 48-hour to 72-hour Available Until dates. Abuse of the Flexibility Contract will be reported to DAS. Note that discussions are to be made on a timely basis in order for peer discussion to be successful.

### Proctored Exams
There are no proctored exams in this course.

### Makeup Quizzes
Makeup quizzes will be given only for missed quizzes excused in advance by the instructor. Excused absences will not be given for airline reservations, routine illnesses (colds, flu, stomach aches), or other common ailments. Excused absences will generally not be given after the absence has occurred, except under very unusual circumstances.

### Incompletes
Incomplete (I) grades will be granted only in emergency cases (usually only for a death in the family, major illness or injury, or birth of your child), and if the student has turned in 80% of the points possible (in other words, usually everything but the final paper). If you are having any difficulty that might prevent you from completing the coursework, please don’t wait until the end of the term; let me know right away.

### Statement Regarding Religious Accommodation
Oregon State University is required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees and students with sincerely held religious beliefs. It is incumbent on the student making the request to make the faculty member aware of the request as soon as possible prior to the need for the accommodation. See the Religious Accommodation Process for Students.

### Guidelines for a Productive and Effective Online Classroom
(Adapted from Dr. Susan Shaw, Oregon State University)
Students are expected to conduct themselves in the course (e.g., on discussion boards, email) in compliance with the university’s regulations regarding civility. Civility is an essential ingredient for academic discourse. All communications for this course should be conducted constructively, civilly, and respectfully. Differences in beliefs, opinions, and approaches are to be expected. In all you say and do for this course, be professional. Please bring any communications you believe to be in violation of this class policy to the attention of your instructor.

Active interaction with peers and your instructor is essential to success in this online course, paying particular attention to the following:
- Unless indicated otherwise, please complete the readings and view other instructional materials for each week before participating in the discussion board.
- Read your posts carefully before submitting them.
- Be respectful of others and their opinions, valuing diversity in backgrounds, abilities, and experiences.
- Challenging the ideas held by others is an integral aspect of critical thinking and the academic process. Please word your responses carefully, and recognize that others are expected to challenge your ideas. A positive atmosphere of healthy debate is encouraged.

### Expectations for Student Conduct: https://beav.es/codeofconduct The following is adapted from Dr. Susan Shaw, Oregon State University
- Make a personal commitment to learning about, understanding, and supporting your peers.
- Assume the best of others in the class and expect the best from them.
- Acknowledge the impact of sexism, racism, ethnocentrism, classism, heterosexism, ageism, and ableism on the lives of class members.
- Recognize and value the experiences, abilities, and knowledge each person brings to class. Value the diversity of the class.
- Participate actively in the discussions, having completed the readings and thought about the issues.
- Pay close attention to what your classmates write in their online comments. Ask clarifying questions, when appropriate. These questions are meant to probe and shed new light, not to minimize or devalue comments.
- Think through and re-read your comments before you post them.
- Never make derogatory comments toward another person in the class.
- Do not make sexist, racist, homophobic, or victim-blaming comments at all.
- Disagree with ideas, but do not make personal attacks.
- Be open to being challenged or confronted with your ideas or prejudices.
- Challenge others with the intent of facilitating growth. Do not demean or embarrass others.
- Encourage others to develop and share their ideas.

Student conduct is governed by the university’s policies, as explained in the Student Conduct Code (https://beav.es/codeofconduct). Students are expected to conduct themselves in the course
  
(e.g., on discussion boards, email postings) in compliance with the university's regulations regarding civility.

By the time you finish this course and leave the university, you will want to have practiced appropriate ways to communicate in writing so that you appear professional at all times. [NACE's Job Outlook 2018](https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/press/2017/the-key-attributes-employers-seek-on-students-resumes/) lists attributes employers want to see on new college graduates' resumes. Written Communication Skills is in the top 3! Remember that when you communicate online, you cannot provide eye contact and body language to help explain yourself, so your message may be misunderstood. Sometimes the thread of a message is lost, making readers rely on memory (which is often faulty). And if you need the reader to act on your request, good manners will help you be successful.

Some of the topics we'll cover in this class will evoke negative feelings. So that the sharing of those feelings is met with support and not more negativity, our behavior towards each other will remain civil. We will use our best manners when questioning ideas so that all students (as well as the instructor and teaching assistants) feel safe and not alienated or bullied. This is the way of the world...without manners, the world descends into chaos.

If you feel you are being harassed or bullied in this course, please report it to the instructor immediately. Describe the situation and provide links to the locations of the harassment so the instructor can address it. Follow the discussion netiquette posted on Canvas a a golden rule on how to interact with your peers in this course, and others.

Any students who do not follow the guidelines above will be dealt with in the following ways:
1. A private message from the instructor asking for a behavior change.
2. Reporting to the Student Conduct office ([OSU Bullying Policy](http://eoa.oregonstate.edu/bullying-policy))
3. Reporting to the Equal Opportunity office ([OSU Student Conduct Reporting](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/reporting))

### Academic Integrity
Integrity is a character-driven commitment to honesty, doing what is right, and guiding others to do what is right. Oregon State University Ecampus students and faculty have a responsibility to act with integrity in all of our educational work, and that integrity enables this community of learners to interact in the spirit of trust, honesty, and fairness across the globe.

Academic misconduct, or violations of academic integrity, can fall into seven broad areas, including but not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; falsification; assisting; tampering; multiple submissions of work; and unauthorized recording and use.

It is important that you understand what student actions are defined as academic misconduct at Oregon State University. The OSU Libraries offer a tutorial on academic misconduct, and you can also refer to the OSU Student Code of Conduct and the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standard’s website for more information. More importantly, if you are unsure if something will violate our academic integrity policy, ask your professors, GTAs, academic advisors, or academic integrity officers.
Please see the Academic Integrity policy posted on Canvas for the most up to date information.
   
### TurnItIn
Your instructor may ask you to submit one or more of your writings to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service. Your assignment content will be checked for potential plagiarism against Internet sources, academic journal articles, and the papers of other OSU students, for common or borrowed content. Turnitin generates a report that highlights any potentially unoriginal text in your paper. The report may be submitted directly to your instructor or your instructor may elect to have you submit initial drafts through Turnitin, and you will receive the report allowing you the opportunity to make adjustments and ensure that all source material has been properly cited. Papers you submit through Turnitin for this or any class will be added to the OSU Turnitin database and may be checked against other OSU paper submissions. You will retain all rights to your written work. For further information, visit Academic Integrity for Students: Turnitin – What is it?
